> Premature optimization is the root of all evil

You should only optimize your code when necessary. 

## Keep your R version updated.

One of the relatively easy optimizations available is to use an up-to-date version of R. In general, R is very conservative, so upgrading doesn't break existing code. However, a new version will often provide free speed boosts for key functions. The `version` command returns a list that contains (among other things) the major and minor version of R currently being used.

```{r version}
# Print the R version details using version
version

# Assign the variable major to the major component
(major <- version$major)

# Assign the variable minor to the minor component
(minor <- version$minor)
```

## Benchmark

Timing with `system.time()`

- **user time**: the CPU time charged for the execution of user instructions
- **system time**: the CPU time charged for execution by the system on behalf of the calling process.
- **elapsed time**: approximately the sum of user and system time, which is ususally the time we care about.

```{Benchmark}
library(microbenchmark)
set.seed(666)
n = 1e8
microbenchmark(
  colon(n),
  seq.default(n),
  seq_by(n)
)
```

`readRDS("data.rds)` is almost 10 times faster than `read.csv("data.csv)`

## How good is your machine

```{r eval = FALSE}
library("benchmarkme")
res = benchmark_std(runs = 3)
plot(res)
upload_results(res)
```

- SALUS windows computer: You are ranked 79 out of 82 machines.
- Macbook Pro 2018: You are ranked 63 out of 82 machines

For many problems your time is the expensive part. If having a faster computer makes you more productive, it can be cost effective to buy one. However, before you splash out on new toys for yourself, your boss/partner may want to see some numbers to justify the expense. Measuring the performance of your computer is called benchmarking, and you can do that with the `benchmarkme` package.

```{r}
(ram <- benchmarkme::get_ram())
(cpu <- benchmarkme::get_cpu())
```

The benchmarkme package allows you to run a set of standardized benchmarks and compare your results to other users. One set of benchmarks tests is reading and writing speeds.

The function call

```{r}
res = benchmarkme::benchmark_io(runs = 1, size = 5)
```

records the length of time it takes to read and write a 50 MB file.


# Fine Tuning: Efficient Base R

## Memory Allocation

In R

- Memory allocation happens automatically
- R allocate memory in RAM to store variables
- Minimize variable assignment for speed

## Example

To create a sequence of numbers:

1. Sequecing: the obvious and best way:

```
x <- 1:n
```

2. Preallocating: not so bad:

```
x <- vector("numeric", n)
for (i in 1:n) {
  x[i] <- i  
}
```

3. Growing: don't ever do this (cardinal sin):

```
x <- NULL
for (i in 1:n) {
  x <- c(x, i) 
}
```

> The first rule of R: never, ever grow a vector.

## The importance of vectorizing your code

General rule:

- Calling an R function eventually leads to C or FORTRAN code
- This code very heavily optimized

Goal:

- Access the underlying C or FORTRAN codes as quickly as possible; the fewer functions call the better.

Vectorized functions

- Many R functions are vectorized
- single number but return a vector `rnorm(4)`
- vector as input `mean(c(36, 48))`


### Looping and vectorizing

Allocation:

- Loop: One-off cost
- Vectorized: comparable

Generation:

- Loop: one million calls to `rnorm()`
- Vectorized: a single call to `rnorm()`


Assignment:

- Loop: One million calls to the assignment method
- Vectorized: a single assignment


## Dataframe and Matrices

- Dataframes: tabular structure with rows and columns. Column data should be the same type while the rows can be different types
- Matrices: a rectangular data structure and you can perform usual subsetting and extracting operations. Every element must be the same data type

> The third rule: Use a matrix whenever appropriate.

Compare selecting columns in a dataframe and matrix

```{r}
zz = as.matrix(mtcars)
summary(microbenchmark::microbenchmark(mtcars[, 1], zz[, 1]))
```

Compare selecting rows in a dataframe and matrix

```{r}
summary(microbenchmark::microbenchmark(mtcars[1, ], zz[1, ]))
```


# Diagnosing Problems: Code Profiling

**Code profiling**

The general idea is to:

- Run the code
- Every few milliseconds, record what is being currently executed
- `Rprof()` comes with R and does exactly this
  - Tricky to use
- Use **profvis** package instead.


**profvis**

- Rstudio has integrated support for profilingn with profvis
- Highlight the code you want to profile
- `Profile -> Profile Selected lines`

Command line

```
library("profvis")

profvis({
  #Your functions here
})
```


The `&` operator will always evaluate both its arguments. That is, if you type `x & y`, R will always try to work out what `x` and `y` are. There are some cases where this is inefficient. For example, if `x` is FALSE, then `x & y` will always be FALSE, regardless of the value of y. Thus, you can save a little processing time by not calculating it. The `&&` operator takes advantage of this trick, and doesn't bother to calculate y if it doesn't make a difference to the overall result.

In this code, if `is_double[1]` is `FALSE` we don't need to evalulate `is_double[2]` or `is_double[3]`, so we can get a speedup by swapping `&` for `&&`.

**One thing to note is that `&&` only works on single logical values**, i.e., logical vectors of length 1 (like you would pass into an if condition), but `&` also works on vectors of length greater than 1.


## Recap of the Monopoly game

### Dataframes VS matrices

- Total monopoly simulation time: 2 seconds to 0.5 seconds
- Creating a dataframe is slower than a matrix
- In the monopoly simulation, we created 10,000 data frames.

### `apply` VS `rowSums`

```
total <- apply(df, 1, sum)
total <- rowSums(df)
```

- 0.5 seconds to 0.16 seconds -> 3 fold speed up

### & VS &&

```
is_double[1] & is_double[2] & is_double[3] # original
is_double[1] && is_double[2] && is_double[3] # updated
```
- Limited speed up
- 0.16 seconds to 0.15 seconds




# Turbo Charged Code: Parallel Programming

**CPU**

- CPU: brains of the computer
- Speed has slowly stabilized
  - CPUs were getting too hot
- Multi-core CPUs
- But R only uses 1 core

```{r}
library("parallel")
detectCores()
```

Monte-Carlo simulations

- 8 core machine
- One simulation per core
- Combine the results at the end
- Embarassingly parallel


But, not everything runs in parallel

**Rule of thumb**

> Can the loop be run forward and backwards?

## The parallel package

- Part of R since 2011 `library("parallel")`
- Cross platform: Code works under Windows, Linux, Mac
- Has parallel versions of standard functions

**The `apply()` function**

- `apply()` is similar to a for loop
  - We apply a function to each row/column of a matrix
- A 10 column, 10,000 row matrix:
`m <- matrix(rnorm(100000), ncol = 10)`
- apply is neater than a for loop
`res <- apply(m, 1, median)`


Converting to parallel

- Load the package `parallel`
- Specifying the number of cores
- Create a cluster object
- Swap to `parApply()`
- Stop!

```{r}
library("parallel")
copiesCore = 4
cl = makeCluster(copiesCore)
parApply(cl, mtcars[,1:5], 2, median)
stopCluster(cl)
```


The bad news:

As Lewis Caroll said:

> The hurrier I go, the behinder I get.

- Sometimes running in parallel is slower due to **thread communication**
- Benchmark both solutions



**The parSapply function in the parallel package**

There are parallel versions of 

- `apply() - parApply()`
- `sapply() - parSapply()`
  - applying a function to a vector
- `lapply() - parLapply()`
  - applying a function to a list
  
`sapply()` is just another way of writing a loop.

```
for (i in 1:10) {
  x[i] <- simulate(i)
}

sapply(1:10, simulate)
```

It is the same recipe:

1. Load the package `parallel`
2. Make a cluster
3. Switch to `parSapply()`
4. Stop!

## Bootstrapping

In a perfect world, we would resample from the population; but we can't

Instead, we assume the original sample is representative of the population

1. Sample with replacement from your data
  - The same point could appear multiple times
2. Calculate the correlation statistics from your new sample
3. Repeat

Converting to parallel

- Load the package
- Specify the number of cores
- Create a cluster object
- Export functions/data


When the number of bootstraps is less than 100, it is quicker to run with just one core.


```{r eval=FALSE}
play <- function() {
  total <- no_of_rolls <- 0
  while(total < 10) {
    total <- total + sample(1:6, 1)

    # If even. Reset to 0
    if(total %% 2 == 0) total <- 0 
    no_of_rolls <- no_of_rolls + 1
  }
  no_of_rolls
}

library(parallel)

# Create a cluster via makeCluster (2 cores)
cl <- makeCluster(2)

# Export the play() function to the cluster
clusterExport(cl, "play")

# Parallelize this code
res <- parSapply(cl, 1:100, function(i) play())

# Stop the cluster
stopCluster(cl)
```
