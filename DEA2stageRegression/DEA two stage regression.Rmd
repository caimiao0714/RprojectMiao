Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is a commonly used method to estimate the efficiency scores of decision making units.

In this simulation, I used the following variable notations:

- I: input variables used in DEA
- O: output variables used in DEA
- X: independent variables used in the second-stage regression

```{r data}
require(Benchmarking)


```
