    "\n",
    "**Early stopping** works by testing the XGBoost model after every boosting round against a hold-out dataset and stopping the creation of additional boosting rounds (thereby finishing training of the model early) if the hold-out metric (\"rmse\" in our case) does not improve for a given number of rounds.\n",

    "Here you will use the `early_stopping_rounds` parameter in `xgb.cv()` with a large possible number of boosting rounds (50). Bear in mind that if the holdout metric continuously improves up through when `num_boosting_rounds` is reached, then early stopping does not occur."

    "- colsample_bytree: the fraction of features you can select from during any given boosting round and must also be a value between 0 and 1. A large value means that almost all features can be used to build a tree during a given boosting, whereas a small value means that the fraction of features that can be selected from is very small. In general, smaller colsample_bytree values can be thought of as providing additional regularization to the model, whereas using all columns may in certain cases overfit a trained model.\n",
