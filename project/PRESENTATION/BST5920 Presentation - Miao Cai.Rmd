# Shanxi weather data

All the historical temperature data were scraped from [2345 Historical Weather](http://tianqi.2345.com/wea_history/53772.htm), published by [China Meteorological Administration](http://www.cma.gov.cn/en2014/).

* year 2013 to 2017
* 127 counties, 11 cities
* a wide range in latitude and complex and different types of landforms
  + distinct four seasons
  + different temperature patterns between north and south Shanxi
  + different temperature patterns between winter and summer
  + different temperature patterns between day and night

# Temperature trends

It shows temperature trends on any selected periods between January 1, 2013 and November 28, 2017 in any of the 127 counties in Shanxi, China.

# Example

.center2[
```{r trend, message =F, echo=F,fig.width=11, fig.height=6, fig.align='center'}
require(tidyverse)
require(xts)
require(dygraphs)

load("manual_data.Rdata")

manual_data %>%
      select(tmax, tmed, tmin) %>%
      xts(., order.by = manual_data$date) %>%
      dygraph(main = "Temperature trend in Datong County, 
              Datong City, Shanxi China",
              y = "Temperature in Fahrenheits") %>%

# Temperature variation
## Sources:

- Horizontal variation ( $V_h$ ): the sum of the absolute difference between the average temperature in two consecutive days in the past week. 
- Vertical variation ( $V_v$ , a.k.a. diurnal range): the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum temperature during a day.


$$V_h = \sum_{i = \text{d} - 7}^{\text{d}} \Big|T_i - T_{i - 1}\Big|$$

Where $d$ is today's date.

$$V_v = T_{max} - T_{min}$$

This decomposition allows for temperature variation within a day and temperature variation across multiple days.
