Data sources
------------

### Real-time ping

The J.B. Hunt Transport Services, a commercial trucking and transportation company in the United States, will provid me real-time ping data generated between April 1st, 2015 and March 29th, 2016. During this time, a small device was installed in each of their truck, which will ping irregularly (typically every 2-10 minutes). Each ping will collect real-time data on the vehicle number, date and time, latitude, longitude, driver identification number (ID), and speed at that second. The driver ID is de-identified and no real driver names will be involved. In total, there are 1,494,678,173 pings.

### Truck crashes and SCEs

Real-time time-stamped SCEs and associated GPS locations for all trucks were collected by the truck company and accessible to me as outcome variables. Three types of critical events were recorded:

1.	Hard brake
2.	Headway
3.	Rolling stability

Once some thresholds with regard to the driving behavior were met, the sensor will be automatically triggered and the information of these SCEs (latitude, longitude, speed, driver ID) will be recorded.

<!-- There were 12,458 critical events created by the 496 truck drivers during the study period.-->

### Driver demographics

A table that includes the birth date of each driver will be provided by the J.B. Hunt Transport Services. The age of the driver can be calculated from this table and merged back to the trips, shifts, and crashes tables via a common unique driver ID.

### Weather data from the `Dark Sky API`

Weather variables, including *precipitation intensity*, *precipitation probability*, *wind speed*, and *visibility*, will be retrieved from the `Dark Sky API`. 
The `Dark Sky API` allows the users to query historic minute-by-minute weather data anywhere on the globe [@darksky]. 
According to the official document, the `Dark Sky API` is supported by a wide range of weather data sources, which are aggregated together to provide the most precise weather data possible for a given location [@darkskyds]. 
Among several different weather data providers I tested, the `Dark Sky API` provides the most accurate and complete weather variables.

To reduce the cost of querying weather data, we will focus on 496 drivers conducting regional work, which generated around the 13 million real-time ping data. These latitude and longitude coordinates will be rounded to two decimal places, which are worth up to 1.1 kilometers. 
We will also round the time to the nearest hour and ignore those stopping pings. 
This reduction algorithm will scaled the original 13 million real-time ping data down to around five million unique latitude-longitude-date-time combinations. 
We will use the R package `darksky` to obtain weather variables for these reduced give million unique  combinations [@hrbrmstr]. 
The weather data for these combinations will then be merged back to the original ping data.
A minimal example of R code to retrieve weather data from the DarkSky API can be found in Appendix \@ref(weatherdat).

### Road geometry data from the `OpenStreetMap`

Two road geometry variables for the 496 regional truck drivers will be queried from the `OpenStreetMap` (OSM) project: *speed limits* and *the number of lanes*. 
The OSM data are collaboratively collected by over two million registered users via manual survey, GPS devices, aerial photography, and other open-access sources [@wikiOSM]. 
The OpenStreetMap Foundation supports a website to make the data freely available to the public under the Open Database License. 

We will query the speed limits and the number of lanes by specifying a bounding box by defining a center point, as well as the width and height in meters in the `center_bbox()` function available from the `osmar` R package [@eugster2013osmar]. 
We will use real-time longitudes and latitudes as the center point and defined a $100\times100$ meters box to retrieve the two variables. 
If the $100\times100$ meters box is too small to have any road geometry data, we will expand the box to $500\times500$ and then $1000\times1000$ to obtain geometry data. 
If the OSM API returned data from multiple geometry structures, we will take the mean of the returned values as the output. 
The R code to retrieve road geometry data can be found in Appendix \@ref(roadgeometry).

The average length of a trip in this study is 2.31 hours with the standard deviation of 1.8 hours.

The Shift_ID column in Table 1 shows different shifts, separated by an eight-hour threshold. 
The average length of a shift in this study is 8.42 hours with the standard deviation of 2.45 hours.
