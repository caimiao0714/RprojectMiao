\hl{Describes the research problems to be addressed and why these are important issues.}

The overarching goal of this proposed study is to 

1. **Aim1**: to examine the association between truck crashes and critical events using a Gamma-Poisson regression.


2. **Aim2**: to construct three scalable Bayesian hierarchical models for SCEs: logistic regression, Poisson regression, and non-homogeneous Poisson process.


3. **Aim3**: to propose an innovative reliability model that accounts for both within shift cumulative driving time and within-shift between-trip rest time.



**Gaps in literature**

- A focus on crashes instead of precursors of crashes
- A focus on road segments rather than drivers
- A focus on case-control comparison given the rareness of truck crashes rather than rates
- A focus on small-scale data
- A focus on traditional statistical models instead of recurrent events models
